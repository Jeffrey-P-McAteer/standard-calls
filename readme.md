# Standard-Calls

This is a collection of components which create an easy-to-use, reliable, scaleable-as-your-network-io-is
system of business logic. A very explicit goal is to make writing business logic modular and isolated as a defense
against the storm that is moving business requirements in modern software. Despite the modularity, overhead is
minimized to the point of a rounding error.
